# TakeOff

TakeOff is a startup / app in Doree Shafrir's amazing novel _Startup_. The premise is basic: it's a workplace wellness app, rate your mood & we'll help you be more productive and successful at work. Throughout the novel, the founder is trying to open up a new feature where the app will **predict** your moods and help you more immediately solve them, or prevent new bad moods from occurring altogether. This app will not do that.

What _this_ TakeOff app does is as follows:

1. Rate your mood (choose from Good, Bad, Angry, Exhausted, Overwhelmed, and Grumpy)
2. Give you advice based on the mood you've input
3. For now, that is all :) 


### To Do
- [x] add gradients to view controllers (programmatically? background image?)
- [ ] import a custom font to use
- [ ] create launch screen
- [x] create app icon
- [x] switch mood buttons to be emojis
- [ ] keep track of which moments of advice the user has seen / not
- [ ] get advice options from a server / backend??
- [ ] track user data in a way that could be useful ??
